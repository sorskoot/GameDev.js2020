Must!: 
    - VR --> A-Frame / Babylon+Unity3D
    - 

Ideas:
    - Name: Futurus II
    - Move object in "time" take them back or forward in time, ie "Change The Future"
    - Travel through space, time difference on earth
    - unicorns with lazers.. That's the future!
    - Bullet time - 
    - Sand Timer - Times flow in direction of the sand
    - Time grenades
    - Crystal Ball 
    - Something with GIT, the train tracks view... each feature branch shows the future until merged to master

    - Crystal ball to predict path of a purple hamster riding a unicorn shooting lazers through maze

    - "Roguelike" - travel to future to change something you will encounter when playing the game. 
        ~ Only travel to future for a small amount of time to get something done. For example stand on a button, start shooting an enemy that is too though to handle alone or do something with lazers. 
        ~ travel to the future; 1) for x amount of seconds then return 2) skip y amount of second into the future. 
        ~ find upgrades to stay in the future longer
        ~ Use portals as well.
        ~ Time grenades, but can only be used in the future to move something to the past.
        ~ https://github.com/dmarcos/aframe-motion-capture-components
        ~ Maybe we should not go the roguelike path, but for now create a couple of levels by hand. For the compo most people will play the games for about 5mins anyway.
        ~ jump into the future to;
            stand on a button to open a door
            hold a button to move a platform
        ~ Maybe create a certain mood by don't use black but a dark red for example 

Todo:
    core mechanics:
        ✔ detect if player or time-traveler is standing 'on' a button @done(20-04-16 23:44)
        ✔ Use a button to start the jump to the future @done(20-04-17 00:18)
        ☐ @today Jump back to the past after the time is out
        ✔ send an event when we end the collision with an object @done(20-04-16 23:44)
        ☐ Make special version for desktop
        ☐ Visual indicator of the capturing / "Time Traver" state.
